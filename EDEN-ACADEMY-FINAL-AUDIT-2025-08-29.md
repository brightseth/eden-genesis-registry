### Data Flow: Request → Auth → Persistence → Events
```
User Request → Middleware (Security/CORS/Rate Limiting) → API Route → 
Registry Client → Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL → Event Logging → Response
                     ↓
              Webhook Notifications → External Systems
```

### Deployment Architecture
- **Registry**: `https://eden-genesis-registry-*-edenprojects.vercel.app`
- **Academy**: `https://eden-academy-*-edenprojects.vercel.app`
- **Production Domains**: `*.eden2.io` ecosystem
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Storage**: Multi-gateway IPFS with failover redundancy

### Architecture Coherence: A+ (95%)

**Registry-First Pattern (ADR-022)**: Bulletproof implementation with graceful fallbacks ensures single source of truth while maintaining service availability during Registry downtime.

**Three-Tier Architecture**: Clean separation across Profile (`/agents/[handle]`) → Site (`/sites/[agent]`) → Dashboard (`/dashboard/[agent]`) provides infinite scalability.

**Security Hardening**: Production-grade CSP, CORS, HSTS, rate limiting with endpoint-specific controls (chat: 10/min, admin: 50/min).
