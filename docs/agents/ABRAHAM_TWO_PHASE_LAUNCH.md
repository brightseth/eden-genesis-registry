## Risk Mitigation

4. **Regulatory issues** → Legal review + compliance

## Key Decisions Needed

### **Immediate (This Week)**
1. Chain selection (Ethereum vs L2)
2. Fixed price vs Dutch auction for Oct 5
3. Purchase limits per wallet
4. Metadata reveal strategy

### **Next Week**
1. $ABRAHAM token launch timing
2. Liquidity provision amount
3. Marketing budget allocation
4. PR agency selection

## Revenue Distribution
