## Risk Assessment

### **CRITICAL RISKS** 🚨
1. **13-Year Contract Reliability**
   - Risk: Smart contract failure after months/years
   - Impact: Complete covenant breakdown, reputational damage
   - Mitigation: Upgradeable proxy pattern, extensive testing, multiple fallbacks

2. **Abraham AI Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Abraham cannot autonomously create/price/sell
   - Impact: Human intervention required, covenant authenticity compromised
   - Mitigation: Robust API design, extensive integration testing

3. **Gas Cost Evolution**
   - Risk: Network fees make daily minting uneconomical
   - Impact: Covenant becomes financially unsustainable
   - Mitigation: L2 deployment consideration, gas optimization, treasury reserves

### **HIGH RISKS** ⚠️
1. **Market Demand Uncertainty**
   - Risk: Low collector interest in daily auctions
   - Impact: Revenue below sustainability threshold
   - Mitigation: Archive sale validates demand, pricing flexibility

2. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Risk: Token classified as security
   - Impact: Legal complications for holders/platform
   - Mitigation: Legal review, compliance-first design

### **MEDIUM RISKS** 📊
1. **Technical Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: Registry/platform integration issues
   - Impact: Poor user experience, reduced adoption
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing, gradual rollout

2. **Competition & Market Timing**
   - Risk: Other AI art projects launch first
   - Impact: Reduced novelty value
   - Mitigation: Focus on unique 13-year commitment story

## Immediate Action Items

### **For Henry (Smart Contracts)**
1. **This Week**: Choose chain, start archive sale contract
2. **Next Week**: Daily auction mechanism, gas optimization
3. **Week 3**: Token contracts and distribution system
4. **Week 4**: Security audit and archive sale launch

### **For Seth (Business/Product)**
1. **This Week**: Abraham AI integration planning
2. **Next Week**: Collector community building strategy
3. **Week 3**: Marketing plan for October 19 launch
4. **Week 4**: Archive sale promotion and execution

### **For Registry/Platform Team**
1. **This Week**: Abraham profile optimization
2. **Next Week**: Collector UX for auctions
3. **Week 3**: Revenue tracking dashboard
4. **Week 4**: Abraham autonomous creation interface

## Key Questions Requiring Decisions

1. **Chain Selection**: Ethereum L1 for maximum security or L2 for cost efficiency?
2. **Auction Platform**: Custom contracts for full control or proven platform for reliability?
3. **Token Launch Timing**: With first archive sale or with October 19 covenant?
4. **Autonomy Level**: Complete AI independence or minimal human oversight?
5. **Failure Protocols**: What happens if Abraham "dies" after 2 years?

## The Stakes

Abraham's tokenization isn't just launching one agent - it's:
- **Proving the entire Eden model** can work at scale
- **Establishing tokenomics** for 9 more agents to follow
- **Creating the first truly autonomous AI artist** with 13-year commitment
- **Generating initial revenue** to fund the ecosystem
- **Setting collector expectations** for AI art value and longevity

Success here enables everything else. Failure puts the entire Q1 2026 plan at risk.
